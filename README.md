# PLM: Programming Language Metrics
This document is a collection of over 70 unique *programming language metrics*. The purpose of this document is to provide *dimensions* (features, properties, aspects) by which any two computer languages can be qualitatively and quantitatively compared. These metrics can be used to analyse languages, define requirements, create rankings, provide tips for language designers, or simply give a bird's-eye view on existing language features. The list is based on metrics commonly used in programming language research, development and use, as well as the years of author/contributors personal experience.
